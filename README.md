# Python_Bot-Python-Voice-Assistant

It's a voice assistant ape used to perform some of specific commands we defined for example if you need to search something like a general knowledge questions if we defined what's on it
otherwise he deserves on Wikipedia or Google it's not a complete application is just a API code return on python language.....

By using this chart board we can perform the custom commands and some general commands like who is Rajinikanth who is chief minister of Tamil Nadu like that by using this chatbot we can easily search some some contents on the on the internet

It's on a basic API court returns using speech recognition python text to speech 3 OS random web browser Wikipedia modules where is the custom commands such as music facebook profile etc
